CHO
=== 
Programming FPGAs with OpenCL is now becoming mainstream. However, unlike software, there are no benchmarks for evaluating these compilers. CHO is an attempt at providing  some sort of "standard" benchmark suite.

CHO is  a suite of benchmarks applications for OpenCL FPGA platforms. We started off by porting [CHStone][chstone] to OpenCL. We will be adding more applications with time. This paper (CHO: A Benchmark Suite for OpenCL-based FPGA Accelerators) is a good introduction/refresher on FPGA, OpenCL or High-level Synthesis.
