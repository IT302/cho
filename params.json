However, unlike software, there are no benchmarks for evaluating these compilers. CHO is an attempt at providing  some sort of \"standard\" benchmark suite.\r\n\r\nCHO is  a suite of benchmarks applications for OpenCL FPGA platforms. We started off by porting [CHStone][chstone] to OpenCL. We will be adding more applications with time. This paper (CHO: A Benchmark Suite for OpenCL-based FPGA Accelerators) is a good introduction/refresher on FPGA, OpenCL or High-level Synthesis.\r\n\r\nPapers\r\n======\r\n- [CHO: A Benchmark Suite for OpenCL-based FPGA Accelerators][techreport1]. <br>\r\n  Geoffrey Ndu, Mikel Lujan, Javier Navaridas. <br>\r\n  University Manchester Technical Report UNIMAN-COMP-APT-TR-02-05-2014.\r\n  May 2, 2014.\r\n\r\n[techreport1]: https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/uk-ac-man-scw:228247\r\n[chstone]:http://www.ertl.jp/chstone/\r\n\r\n  \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
